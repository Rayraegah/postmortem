## What happened:
> Include:
> - A basic narrative of what happened
> - Timing about when the incident occurred, when it was resolved, and any other key moments
> - Any other relevant facts about what occurred

## Impact on Customers
> Include:
> - Messages from affected customers
> - Links to these conversations within your support system, if applicable

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps
> Include:
> - Root causes of the incident
> - Lessons learned about your team's processes, communication flow, or code
> - Ideas for mitigating or avoiding incidents like this in the future

### Root Cause Analysis
#### The Problem
> Describe the problem and how it manifested itself. Include detail on who was impacted by 
> the problem and how they were impacted.

#### The Timeline
> Map out every event that led up to the problem. Map out each inflection point where the problem
> could have been avoided, had the team done something differently. Map out every point where
> the problem grew worse.

#### Potential Root Causes and Contributing Factors
> Ask yourself and your team the following questions. Repeat for each potential root cause you identify.
> - What might have caused the problem?
> - Why did that arise? (ask this repeatedly, until you get to the deepest underlying cause)
> - Is this a root cause (ie the problem could not had occurred, had this not happened?) or a contributing factor?

#### Evidence
> What evidence do you have to show that each root cause was the culprit?

> Can you find evidence that demonstrates the problem could have been avoided, had things
been handled differently?

#### Avoiding Future Problems
> What could be done differently in the future to fix these root causes and avoid problems?

> Are there multiple approaches that can help avoid future problems? If so, is there one approach
> that’s less expensive or less labor-intensive than the others, while still being as effective?

> After you’ve implemented changes to avoid the root causes, how effective were the changes? Ie
> did you avoid the problem from occurring again?

> Have you noticed additional root causes you should address?

#### The Process
> Discuss, as a team, how well (or poorly) the process worked. Discuss whether there are things
> you plan to adjust in the process when you next use the RCA approach.
