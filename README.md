# Postmortem Template
Postmortems (or post-mortem/post morem) are at core of every incident. It’s a process that involves analysis, discussion after an event has taken place to get to the root cause of an issue, learn from it, and make sure it doesn’t happen again. 

This is a template that can help you easily share what happened, why, how it impacted customers, and lessons learned for the future for next steps to improve.
